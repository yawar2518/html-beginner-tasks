# 🌐 HTML Beginner Tasks  

This repository documents my journey of learning and practicing **HTML fundamentals and advanced concepts**.  
All practice tasks are neatly organized into two folders:  

- 📂 **Basic Tasks** → Beginner-friendly projects to build a strong foundation.  
- 📂 **Advance Tasks** → More complex projects combining multiple concepts.
